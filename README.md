**Objectives**

A dense matrix is a matrix in which almost all matrix entries are non-zero.  On the other hand, a sparsematrix contains entries that are mostly zero.  In this assignment, you will implement the Strassen’s algorithmfor multiplying two dense square matrices.  With regular matrix multiplication,  you can use three nestedloops and directly compute the product.  The complexity of regular matrix multiplication is O(n3) wherenis the size of the square matrices that are being multiplied.  As the size of the matrices grow, the processingpower  required  for  computations  also  increases  in  a  cubic  manner.   Amongst  all  arithmetic  operations,multiplication  is  the  most  intensive  and  expensive  operation.   The  Strassen’s  algorithm  was  proposed  byVolker Strassen in the 1960s in an attempt to make dense matrix multiplication more efficient (i.e.  entails lessmultiplication operations).  This algorithm has been proven to be more efficient than regular multiplicationand has an efficiency of approximately O(n2.8).  Although many more efficient algorithms for dense matrixmultiplication have been proposed at recent times, we will focus on implementing the Strassen’s algorithmfor this assignment.
